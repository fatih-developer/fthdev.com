### Requirements Document
This is a Requirements Document for a software feature in a SaaS startup. It captures the high-level user stories and detailed acceptance criteria that define what the feature must do from a business and user perspective. User stories describe goals like "As a [user type], I want [feature] so that [benefit]," while acceptance criteria specify conditions like "WHEN [action] THEN [expected outcome]." This document ensures alignment across teams, prevents misunderstandings, guides development and testing, and serves as a reference for validating the final product against initial needs.

### Design Document
This is a Design Document for a software feature in a SaaS startup. It provides a technical blueprint that translates requirements into an architectural plan, including diagrams for component hierarchies and state flows, detailed interfaces for state management and components, data models, error handling strategies, and considerations for performance, localization, accessibility, and future integrations. It bridges the gap between business needs and implementation, promoting scalable and maintainable code while allowing for reviews and iterations before coding begins.

### Implementation Plan
This is an Implementation Plan (or Tasks Document) for a software feature in a SaaS startup. It breaks down the development process into sequential, actionable tasks with checkboxes for tracking progress, subtasks for granularity, and cross-references to requirements. It covers setup, core implementation, testing, and final verification, ensuring efficient execution, dependency management, and accountability in an agile environment. This document acts as a roadmap for sprints, helping teams monitor progress, identify issues early, and deliver the feature on time.
